Internet-Draft                   JSOND                        March 2015


1.  Introduction

   JSOND (JSON Definition) is a simple, yet powerful, definition
   language for JSON text.

   The purpose of JSOND is to facilitate development and documentation
   of JSON text.

   JSOND is designed to be a minimal superset of JSON.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
2.  JSOND Grammar

   JSOND text is JSON text that MAY include JSOND grammar. JSOND
   grammar is a superset of JSON grammar [RFC7159] [RFC4627]
   [ECMA-404].  The rest of this document describes the JSOND grammar
   in ABNF [RFC5234] and text.

2.1.  Values

   A JSOND value MUST be an object, array or a string.

      value = object / array / string

2.2.  Objects

   A JSOND object MUST define all members in the corresponding JSON
   object.  A JSON object MUST NOT contain a member that has not been
   defined in the corresponding JSOND object.

      value = object                           ; e.g. { "a": "string" }

2.3.  Arrays

   A JSOND array defines zero or more values.  All values in a JSON
   array MUST be defined by at least one of the values in the
   corresponding JSOND array.

      value = array                            ; e.g. [ "string" ]

2.4.  Booleans

   A JSOND boolean defines that the corresponding JSON value MUST be
   true or false.

      value = %x22.62.6f.6f.6c.65.61.6e.22     ; "boolean"

Internet-Draft                   JSOND                        March 2015


2.5.  Strings

   A JSOND string defines that the corresponding JSON value MUST be any
   string.

      value = %x22.73.74.72.69.6e.67.22        ; "string"

   Regular expressions [ECMA-262] MAY be used to define a subset of
   strings.

      value = %x22 regular-expression %x22     ; e.g. "[a-z]"

2.4.  Numbers and Integers

   A JSOND number defines that the corresponding JSON value MUST be any
   number.

      value = %x22.6e.75.6d.62.65.72.22        ; "number"

   A JSOND integer defines that the corresponding JSON value MUST be
   any integer.

      value = %x22.69.6e.74.65.67.65.72.22     ; "integer"

2.4.1  Sets and Intervals

   An arbitrary number of mathematical sets and intervals [ISO-80000-2]
   MAY be used to define a subset of numbers.

   A corresponding JSON number MUST match a number in the defined
   subset.

      begin-exclusive = %x28                   ; (

      end-exclusive = %x29                     ; )

      integer = [ minus ] zero / ( digit1-9 *DIGIT )

      number = integer [ frac ] [ exp ]

      set = begin-object number *( value-separator number ) end-object

      interval = begin-array / begin-exclusive ( ( number
      value-separator ) / ( number value-separator number ) /
      ( value-separator number ) ) end-array / end-exclusive

      value = %x22 1*( set / interval ) %x22   ; e.g. "[1.0,2.0)"

   Set elements SHOULD be ordered in increasing order from the least
   to the greatest element.  There must be at least one element.

   The left or right interval endpoint is OPTIONAL.  An undefined left
   endpoint defines negative infinity.  An undefined right endpoint
   defines positive infinity.  If both endpoints are provided the left
   endpoint MUST be less than the right endpoint.

   An interval that is declared using integers defines the
   corresponding subset of integers.  An interval MUST be declared using
   at least one number with an explicit decimal component to define a
   subset of real numbers.  The decimal component MAY be .0.

   Insignificant whitespace is OPTIONAL in sets and intervals.

2.5.  References

   Any JSOND value MAY be persisted as a file.  A file SHOULD be
   referenced using a relative path, an absolute path, or using the
   http or https scheme [RFC3986].

   value = %x22 [ scheme ] path %x22           ; e.g. "file.jsond"


   JSOND files SHOULD have the filename extension .jsond.  Circular
   references SHOULD be avoided.

2.6.  Constants

   A value that is not valid JSOND grammar SHOULD be interpreted as a
   constant and thus REQUIRED in the corresponding JSON text.

   The literals, true, false, and null are not valid JSOND grammar.
   Numbers are not valid JSOND grammar.

   Most strings are valid regular expressions and thus valid JSOND
   grammar.  String constants SHOULD include boundary matchers.

2.7.  Optionals

   A member can be defined as optional by appending a question mark to
   the end of the name.

      name = %x22 *char [ %x3f ] %x22          ; e.g. "name?"

   An optional member MAY have the value null.  An optional member MAY
   be undefined in JSON text.
